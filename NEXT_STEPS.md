# Next Steps: Test Coverage & Quality Improvements

## Executive Summary

**Current State:** 185 tests across 4 layers (Unit, Integration, API, UI E2E)
**Coverage Focus:** `/events` module has comprehensive coverage (>85%)
**Critical Gap:** `/login`, `/registrations`, and `/error` pages have zero test coverage

---

## 1. Critical Path Coverage Gaps

### Missing Features (Priority: P0)

| Feature | Current Coverage | Risk Impact |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Login/Authentication | 0% | **Critical** - Blocks all user access |
| Registrations Page | 0% | **High** - Core user feature |
| Error Handling | 0% | **Medium** - Poor UX during failures |
| Auth API Routes | 0% | **Medium** - OAuth & signout flows |

**Recommendation:** Prioritize login and registrations testing before any other work. These are foundational to the user journey.

---

## 2. Unit Tests Improvements

**Current:** 122 tests, >85% coverage for `/events`

### Suggested Enhancements:

- **Add edge case testing** - Empty states, null values, boundary conditions
- **Add accessibility tests** - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Expand to untested modules** - Login actions, registration actions
- **Add performance assertions** - Test re-render counts, component optimization

**Impact:** Medium - Incremental quality improvement

---

## 3. Integration Tests Improvements

**Current:** 30 tests covering 5 business domains

### Suggested Enhancements:

- **Add cross-entity relationship tests** - Cascading deletes, referential integrity
- **Add data migration tests** - Schema changes, backfill scripts
- **Add performance tests** - Large dataset handling, N+1 query detection
- **Expand to auth & user management** - Session management, user permissions

**Impact:** Medium - Catches database-level bugs

---

## 4. API Tests Improvements

**Current:** 19 tests covering `/events` server actions

### Suggested Enhancements:

- **Add security tests** - Authorization checks, SQL injection, XSS protection
- **Expand coverage to missing APIs** - Login, registrations, user profile
- **Add rate limiting tests** - Throttling, backoff strategies
- **Add error scenario tests** - Network failures, timeout handling

**Impact:** High - Critical for production security

---

## 5. UI E2E Tests Improvements

**Current:** 14 tests covering event registration flow only

### Suggested Enhancements:

- **Add complete user journeys** - Login → Browse → Register → View Registrations → Logout
- **Add browser compatibility** - Currently only Chromium; add Firefox and WebKit
- **Add responsive design tests** - Mobile, tablet, desktop viewports
- **Split tests into multiple files** - Better organization and parallel execution
- **Add visual regression testing** - Catch unintended UI changes

**Effort:** 2-3 weeks
**Impact:** High - Covers critical user paths

---

## 6. CI/CD Improvements

**Current:** Sequential job execution (Unit → Integration → API → UI)

### Suggested Enhancements:

- **Parallel execution** - Run Integration + API tests in parallel to reduce CI time
- **Test sharding** - Split UI tests across multiple runners for faster feedback
- **Flaky test detection** - Automatically identify and quarantine unreliable tests
- **Add pre-commit hooks** - Run unit tests before allowing commits
- **Cache optimization** - Cache Playwright browsers and Supabase Docker images

**Impact:** High - Faster developer feedback

## 7. Additional Testing Layers

### Currently Missing:

| Test Type | Current State | Priority | Impact |
|-----------|---------------|----------|--------|
| **Security Testing** |  None | High | Critical for production |
| **Accessibility Testing** |  None | Medium | Required for WCAG compliance |
| **Performance Testing** |  None | Medium | Optimize user experience |
| **Load Testing** |  None | Low | Understand system limits |

### High-Level Recommendations:

- **Security:** Add OWASP Top 10 validation, pen testing, dependency scanning
- **Accessibility:** Add axe-core automated tests, keyboard navigation tests
- **Performance:** Using Jmeter for backend API performance Testing, database query performance tests
- **Load:** Jmeter tests to simulate concurrent users

**Impact:** Medium-High - Production readiness requirements

## 8. Unlocking AI Capabilities

### AI-Powered Testing Enhancements:

- **Test Generation** - Use AI (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) to auto-generate test cases from requirements
- **Smart Test Data** - Generate realistic test data using AI models instead of manual hardcoding
- **Visual Testing** - AI-powered visual regression tools (Applitools, Percy) for intelligent diff detection
- **Flaky Test Analysis** - ML algorithms to identify patterns in flaky tests and suggest root cause fixes
- **Test Coverage Recommendations** - AI analyzes code changes and recommends missing test scenarios
- **Bug Prediction** - ML models to predict high-risk areas needing more test coverage

**Impact:** High - Reduces test creation time by 40-60%, minimizes maintenance effort
